            Mum Space provides a variety of different topics that will appeal to mums with young children. The order in which it is presented can be followed or chosen according to the needs and wants of your own group of mums.
            It is likely that the mums will have pre-school children however most of the material is useful for all primary/junior school age children.
            The aim is to provide a ‘toolbox’ of parenting techniques with the underlying thinking behind them. There is a mass of different opinions on how to parent in our world, hence the aim is to present some of these, sifted, I hope, with wisdom and experience and a Christian starting point.
            There will also be topics related to the whole family, topics on varying relationships that mums have and general lifestyle sessions.

            Use church members expertise and get them involved. Use free online resources eg watch a youtube parenting presentation together and then have a discussion. There are endless resources available.
            Here are some helpful resources: The Parent and Baby Coach,  Crazy Cool Family, Mama Bear Apologetics, Ann Benton books,  Janet Lansbury. Instagram: biglittlefeelings, fiveminutemum, anna. Mathur, podcast: some of the above and: Bible Project, Awesome Marriage Podcast, Naked Marriage Podcast, Risen Motherhood. You and I may or may not agree with all they say, but material can be used as a springboard for discussion.

            I have written a variety of topics, which can be done in order, particularly the first 4 sessions, or pick and choose according to the interests of your group.
            There may be too much material, in which case, cut out whatever suits. Depending on the demographics of your group of mums, some of the material may go into too much depth or simply not be of interest.

            Some groups will like a craft each session, which, if not too complicated, they can do whilst listening. It can help to break down some awkwardness. Other groups of mums may not like craft at all, so just ask your mums! Pinterest has plenty of ideas, and other online resources. Some craft is suggested in the Christmas and Easter sessions.
            Young mums are generally very tired and may have brain fog so don’t forget this! But they are also very keen to learn, share, be supported, encouraged and prayed for. 
            One Muslim mum was almost in tears when she shared her relief to hear that other mums felt like she did, ‘it just helps so much to know that other mums don’t like their children all the time either!’. Honesty and vulnerability breaks down barriers.
