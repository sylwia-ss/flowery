            God There is one God, who exists eternally in three distinct but equal persons: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. God is unchangeable in his holiness, justice, wisdom and love. He is the almighty Creator; Saviour and Judge who sustains and governs all things according to his sovereign will for his own glory.

            The Bible God has revealed himself in the Bible, which consists of the Old and New Testaments alone. Every word was inspired by God through human authors, so that the Bible as originally given is in its entirety the Word of God, without error and fully reliable in fact and doctrine. The Bible alone speaks with final authority and is always sufficient for all matters of belief and practice.

            The Human Race All people, being created male or female in the image of God, have inherent and equal dignity and worth. Their greatest purpose is to obey, worship and love God. Marriage is a creation decree, being the union of one man and one woman, intended for life. As a result of the fall of our first parents, every aspect of human nature has been corrupted and all men and women are without spiritual life, guilty sinners and hostile to God. Every person is therefore under the just condemnation of God and needs to be born again, forgiven and reconciled to God in order to know and please him.

            The Lord Jesus Christ The Lord Jesus Christ is fully God and fully man. He was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of a virgin, and lived a sinless life in obedience to the Father. He taught with authority and all his words are true. He is the only mediator between God and mankind. On the cross he satisfied God’s justice by dying in the place of sinners, bearing God’s punishment for their sin, redeeming them by his blood and defeating the devil. He rose bodily from the dead and in his resurrection body ascended into heaven where he is exalted and reigns as Lord of all. He intercedes for his people in the presence of the Father.

            Salvation Salvation is entirely a work of God’s grace and cannot be earned or deserved. It has been accomplished by the Lord Jesus Christ and is offered to all in the gospel. God in his love forgives sinners whom he calls, granting them repentance and faith. All who believe in Christ are justified by faith alone, credited with Christ’s righteousness, adopted into the family of God and receive eternal life; resulting in works that please God, all to the glory of God alone 
         </p>
         <p class="page_p page_p6 move-page_p">
            The Holy Spirit The Holy Spirit has been sent from heaven to glorify Christ and to apply his work of salvation. He convicts sinners, imparts spiritual life and gives a true understanding of the Scriptures. He indwells all believers, brings assurance of salvation and produces increasing likeness to Christ. He builds up the Church, and renews and empowers its members in holiness, repentance, faith, love, hope, wisdom, worship, service and mission. 
         </p>
         <p class="page_p page_p7 move-page_p">
            The Church The universal Church is the body of which Christ is the head and to which all who are saved belong. It is made visible in local churches, which are congregations of believers who are committed to each other for the worship of God, the preaching of the Word, the administering of baptism and the Lord’s Supper; for pastoral care and discipline, for the preservation of sound teaching, and for evangelism. The unity of the body of Christ is expressed within and between churches by mutual love, care, correction and encouragement in accordance with the Scriptures. True fellowship between churches exists only where they are faithful to the gospel of salvation by grace alone. 
         </p>
         <p class="page_p page_p8 move-page_p">
            Baptism and the Lord’s Supper Baptism and the Lord’s Supper have been given to the churches by Christ as visible signs of the gospel. Baptism is a symbol of union with Christ in his death and resurrection, of the washing away of sins and of entry into his Church, but does not impart spiritual life. The Lord’s Supper is a commemoration of Christ’s sacrifice offered once for all and involves no change in the bread and wine. All its blessings are received by faith. 
         </p>
         <p class="page_p page_p9 move-page_p">
            The Future The Lord Jesus Christ will return to this earth personally, visibly, suddenly and gloriously. He will raise the dead bodily and judge the world in perfect justice and righteousness. The unbeliever will be sent to eternal punishment and the believer will be welcomed into a life of eternal joy in fellowship with God. God will make all things new, creating a new heaven and a new earth, and will be glorified forever.
