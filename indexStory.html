            After being gradually persuaded to act as a mentor mum (really a polite term for an older mum!) for a mums’ support group in our church, I began to really enjoy it as I am passionate about family and raising children and I could see how much the mums benefitted from coming together to discuss ideas and concerns.
            My husband Adam and I have 4 children, 3 boys and a girl who are in their early twenties and late teens. There has been lots of fun, a lot of adventure and chaos and dirt and mess, there still is.  There has been a different type of mess too, which I never imagined, but family is like that and the great thing is that God brings beauty out of the pain and never lets us go and always has a plan and purpose in it for our good.

         <p class="page_p page_p2 move-page_p">
            One purpose for me, was , in the midst of all this, to begin to form the idea of writing a curriculum for a mums’ support group, as we had run out of material to teach the mums. So began a long slow process as I am not good at sitting down to write. I love to read lots of books on parenting and listen to podcasts, but to formulate it into a session well…
            However it gave me time to think over the material, comparing the way I was brought up, with the parenting advice I read as a young mum and now comparing it with current parenting trends. It is fascinating but can be confusing too. So I have tried to give the backbone of parenting essentials, followed by a toolbox of ideas from which mums can pick and choose. Finally I have tried to do it through the lens of the Bible. Does a parenting idea fit with what the Bible says is truth? It is key to parenting, essential in fact, to protect us as we navigate through different ideas that confront us.

            I am passionate about evangelism too, who doesn’t want mums to know about Jesus! But it’s tough and terrifying isn’t it? So this curriculum is a gentle bridge-build, it invites mums (probably from your toddler group or school mums), to look at parenting and to feel supported and cared for. Genuine care, not just so we can then tell them the good news of Jesus. But we do tell the Good News too; you will see how this is done as you read the sessions.
            If this is important for you to know, my qualifications are a Nursing and Health visitor Degree, Biblical and Cross Cultural Diploma, much personal study and most significantly experience as a mum of 4 and volunteering in Mum Ministries for more than 20 years, the latter two probably giving me the most understanding.
            All the very best and I hope you will be inspired to start your own Mum Space group.
