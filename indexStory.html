            After being gradually persuaded to act as a mentor mum (really a polite term for an older mum!) for a mums’ support group in our church, I began to realise how much the mums benefitted from
            coming together to discuss ideas and concerns and it opened
            opportunities to talk about faith.<br><br>
            As the Mums’ group continued, it led to writing on many parenting
            topics. I am passionate about parenting and family and have over the years tried to read
            many books. More recently this has included use of podcasts and Instagram and online
            courses.  <br><br>
            This has enabled me to compare the way I was brought up, with the parenting advice I read
            as a young mum and now comparing it with current parenting trends. It is fascinating but
            can be confusing too. So I have tried to give the backbone of parenting essentials, for
            example the need for boundaries, followed by, in each session, ideas from which mums can
            pick and choose (like a toolbox!). <br><br>
         </p>
         <p class="page_p page_p2">
            Finally I have tried to give advice through the lens of the
            Bible. Does a parenting idea fit with what the Bible says is truth? It is key to parenting,
            essential in fact, to protect us as we navigate through different ideas that confront us.<br>
            I am also passionate about evangelism. But it’s tough and terrifying, isn’t it?<br><br>

            So this mums’ group is a gentle bridge-build, it invites mums (probably from your toddler group or school mums), to look at parenting and to feel supported and cared for. Genuine care, not just so we can then tell them the good news of Jesus. But we do tell the Good News too; you will see how this is done as you read the sessions.<br><br>

            If this is important for you to know, my qualifications are a Nursing and Health visitor
            Degree, Biblical and Cross Cultural Diploma, much personal study and most significantly
            experience as a mum of 4 and volunteering in Mum Ministries at a good Bible-focused
            church for more than 20 years, the latter two probably giving me the most understanding.<br><br>
            All the very best and I hope you will be inspired to start your own Mum Space group.<br><br>
