            After being gradually persuaded to act as a mentor mum (really a polite term for an older mum!) for a mums’ support group in our church, I began to really enjoy it as I am passionate about family and raising children and I could see how much the mums benefitted from coming together to discuss ideas and concerns.<br><br>
            My husband Adam and I have 4 children, 3 boys and a girl who are in their early twenties and late teens. There has been lots of fun, a lot of adventure and chaos and dirt and mess, there still is.  <br><br>
            There has been a different type of mess too, which I never imagined, but family is like that and the great thing is that God brings beauty out of the pain and never lets us go and always has a plan and purpose in it for our good.<br><br>
         </p>
         <p class="page_p page_p2">
            One purpose for me, was , in the midst of all this, to begin to form the idea of writing a curriculum for a mums’ support group, as we had run out of material to teach the mums. So began a long slow process as I am not good at sitting down to write. <br><br>
            I love to read lots of books on parenting and listen to podcasts, but to formulate it into a session well…
            However it gave me time to think over the material, comparing the way I was brought up, with the parenting advice I read as a young mum and now comparing it with current parenting trends. <br><br>
            It is fascinating but can be confusing too. So I have tried to give the backbone of parenting essentials, followed by a toolbox of ideas from which mums can pick and choose. Finally <br><br>
            I have tried to do it through the lens of the Bible. Does a parenting idea fit with what the Bible says is truth? It is key to parenting, essential in fact, to protect us as we navigate through different ideas that confront us.  
         </p>
         <p class="page_p page_p3">
            I am passionate about evangelism too, who doesn’t want mums to know about Jesus! But it’s tough and terrifying isn’t it?<br> So this curriculum is a gentle bridge-build, it invites mums (probably from your toddler group or school mums), to look at parenting and to feel supported and cared for.<br><br>
            Genuine care, not just so we can then tell them the good news of Jesus. But we do tell the Good News too; you will see how this is done as you read the sessions.<br><br>
            If this is important for you to know, my qualifications are a Nursing and Health visitor Degree, Biblical and Cross Cultural Diploma, much personal study and most significantly experience as a mum of 4 and volunteering in Mum Ministries for more than 20 years, the latter two probably giving me the most understanding.<br>
            All the very best and I hope you will be inspired to start your own Mum Space group.
